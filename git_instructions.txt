The cadcVOFS project is now a subtree project of the opencadc/projects directory.  

To pull in changes from the cadcVOFS project on github do the following (assumes you are working on story s######)

git checkout cadcVOFS_github_branch
git pull cadcVOFS_github master
git checkout s#####
git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit cadcVOFS_github_branch

then, you can make changes in cadcVOFS as you wish and then when you are read to commit:

# do these commands from the project root
cd opencadc  

git commit -m "My changes to cadcVOFS"
git push

# this makes the project root look like the cadcVOFS root
git checkout cadcVOFS_github_branch

# make sure that your cadcVOFS is synced with the github one
git pull  cadcVOFS_github master

# merge in changes made in your opencadc/projects/cadcVOFS directory (which is now only visibel to git)
git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit s######

# commit those changes to github
git commit -m "changes made as part of s#####"
git push


this will keep both projects roughly in-sync

( you can only do the commit to github if you are commiter on that project. ...)
