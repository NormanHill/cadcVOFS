cadcVOFS is filesystem client for access the CADC VOSpace webservice.  

This client uses the python binders on the FUSE library.

Requirements: 
	       A CADC VOSpace account
	       fuse (likely fuse-devel) installed 
	       fuse kernel bindings (part of Linux 2.4 and newer)
	       python2.6 or newer.

There isn't much in here that depends on 2.6.


Install:

sudo python setup.py install

CERTIFICATES:

The CADC uses certificates for authentication.  For mountvofs to work
you must have a valid certificate.  There is a convenience routine
called 'getCert.py' supplied with this package which you can use to
get a new proxy certificate for use with mountvofs and the other
commandline tools.  

usage:  getCert.py 10

will retrieve a certificate with a 10 day validity period.  If you don't supply a number a 2 day certificate is pulled.  By default this certiciate is writen to ${HOME}/.ssl/cadcproxy.pem.

Usage:

mountvofs vos:VOSPACE /mountPoint

Help:
mountvofs --help 

options like -v and -d provide lots of feedback.

--- Note: by default mountvofs will create a cache of your VOSpace at
    the location ${HOME}/vos:VOSPACE where VOSPACE is the name of your
    VOSpace. You can change this default location and the size of the
    cache from the command line.
