This file contains brief instructions on
how to get started with opencadc code.


Check out the opencadc project from the
repository to the directory of your choice.


Building opencadc projects requires the
following directory structure:

    $CADC_PREFIX/
        etc/
        lib/

Create the above directory structure by either of the following methods:

    Define CADC_PREFIX to be the same directory to
    which you checked out the opencadc project.
    
    That directory will already contain the etc directory.
    
    Within $CADC_PREFIX, create the lib directory.
    
  or

    Define CADC_PREFIX to be some other directory on your file system.
    
    Within that directory, create the etc and lib directories.
    
    Copy the opencadc.* files from the etc checkout
    directory to your $CADC_PREFIX/etc directory.
    
    $CADC_PREFIX may be the same directory that already contains
    the etc directory after a checkout from the repository.


Edit $CADC_PREFIX/etc/opencadc.properties, changing the value of ext.lib
to be the directory into which any required non-opencadc jar files
(eg. servlet-api.jar) are collected.

Use ant to build the cadcUtil project.


Copy build/lib/cadcUtil.jar from that project to $CADC_PREFIX/lib/.


Then, build the other project(s) of your choice using their respective
build.xml files.  Remember to add any missing jar files to your
ext.lib directory.
